4. Why arenâ€™t the current nodes upgrading to IPv6 from IPv4?
Answer:

Reason 1: It's would be expensive to deploy.

The internet is made up of millions of routers and switches. Those were initially designed to work with IPv4. Replacing or upgrading core hardware takes time and budget; Billions of old devices, home gateways, print servers, etc, are incompatible with the IPv6 protocol.

Reason 2: NAT backed IPv4.

By the time the IPv6 was developed, NAT was used all over the internet, extending the lifetime of the IPv4 protocol. NAT can be deployed incrementally at a low cost while also providing some basic security. 

Reason 3: Compatibility issues.

IPv6 protocol is incompatibile with the current IPv4 protocol. IPv6 does not provide a single, standardized solution to communicate with devices and systems that still run IPv4.

Reason 4: No benefit of early adoption.

There is no direct benefit of being an early adopter. Nobody will switch to IPv6 as long as none of their contacts is switching too.
