2. What are the key features of NS2 and what is used for ?
Answer:

NS2 stands for Network Simulator Version 2. It is an open-source event-driven simulator designed specifically for research in computer communication networks.

The process of simulation is done by the following steps:
    1. Topology Definition
    2. Development of the model
    3. Link Configuration
    4. Execution
    5. Analysis of the performance
    6. Visualization

Some of the features of NS2 are:
    1. It can simulate both wireless and wired network.
    2. It provides support to bunch of protocols like FTP, UDP, TCP, HTTP.
    3. It is a Unix-based, discrete event simulator.
    4. It uses the C++ programming language for functioning. (Slow to Compile but fast to execute)
    5. There are contributions from third parties.
	6. Uses TCL as its scripting language. (Slow to execute but fast Compilation)
	7. Otcl: Object oriented support
	8. Tclcl: C++ and otcl linkage

There are various research and thesis topics in NS2, such as:
    1. Optical Network
    2. WSAN
    3. Robotic Sensor Network
    4. 5G Network
    5. Spectrum Sensing
