Answer:

Application level Difference between NS2 and NS3:
1.
NS3 	-> NS3 can be act as the emulator that it can connect to the real world	
NS2	-> NS2 can not be act as the emulator.

2.
NS3	-> Some of the NS2 models can be imported to NS3 	
NS2	-> NS3 scripts can not run in NS2 environment


Programming Language level Difference between Ns2 and NS3:
1.
NS3	-> NS3 is written using C++	
NS2	-> NS2 is written with the help of TCL and C++.

2. 
NS3	-> Compilation time is not a matter 	
NS2	-> C++ recompilation takes more time more than TCL so most of the scripts are written using TCL

3.
NS3 -> A Simulation script can be written in ns3	
NS2 -> Simulation script is not possible with NS2

4.
NS3 -> Python is available for the scripting language 	
NS2 -> Only TCL can be used as the scripting language
