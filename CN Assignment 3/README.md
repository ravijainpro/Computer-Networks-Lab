**Questions**

1. Install NS2
2. What are the key features of NS2 and what is used for ?
3. Differences between NS2 and NS3
4. Why arenâ€™t the current nodes upgrading to IPv6 from IPv4?

**Implementations**

**Task 1:** Implement congestion control (leaky bucket algorithm)

**Task 2:** Implement a client-server program to make a client send a file name and a server to send back the contents of the requested file. It should also display appropriate error message in case the requested file is not available with the server.

**Task 3:** Simulate three nodes point-to-point networks with duplex links between them. Set the queue size, vary the bandwidth, and find the number of packets dropped

**Task 4:** Simulate a four-node point-to-point network, and connect the links as follows:
n0 -> n2, n1 -> n2 and n2 -> n3. Apply TCP agent changing the parameters and determine
the number of packets sent/received by TCP/UDP
